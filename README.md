# Eularian-Fluid-Sim

This is a litle side project I am doing for fun to learn more about JS and HTML development.
NOTE: This is NOT my original code, all credits belong to Ten Minute Physics
The original code can be found at: https://github.com/matthias-research/pages/blob/master/tenMinutePhysics/17-fluidSim.html
I plan on making smaller modifications to the code and tinkering with different perameters to learn more about how the entire system works, as I still
do not have a full grasp on the equations or how JS/HTML fully work but I am trying to learn as much as I can for future prejects
